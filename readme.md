# Intermediate Hand-In: Finding Kermit with Audio & Video Features
...
## Source code
src/audio.ipynb ... main pipeline for audio features  
src/audio_tpot.py ... optimal audio classifier as found by TPOT  
src/visual_feat_ext.py ... 
src/evaluation.ipynb ... combines and evaluates audio and video features  
## Complete student data
## Entry point of the code (e.g. main Matlab file)
## Performance indicators (e.g. Recall, Precision, etc.)
## Timesheets
## Infos on architecture, features, classifier, etc. - whatever you consider important/helpful
## If relevant, deep learning model file
## Test data (no videos, but images/audio with ground truth) & Weka Experimenter log file for classifier comparison (if applicable)
## ROC figures of classifier performance
