# Similarity Modeling Project
## Goal
Hand in jupyter-notebook that predicts appearences of kermit the frog an the 2 old men on the muppet show. 3 videos are given and should be in `media/` folder in this root directory

## Episode Train/Test split
- ep1 = 02 02 01 Train
- ep2 = 02 04 04 Test
- ep3 = 03 04 03 Eval

## ToDos for intermediate handin
- only focus on kermit for now, but create ground truths for both classes 
- create classifier for audio and video separately, and/or both combined
    - build ensemble on it
### G
- create ground truth for video 1
- feature extraction audio for kermit
### O
- create ground truth for video 2
- feature extraction video for kermit


## ToDos
- [x] define test/train split strategy
- [x] create ground truth
- [x] extract features 
- [x] train simple classifier
- [ ] do intermediate handin ( **DUE ~~23.11.~~ 7.12. ** )
- [ ] train more sophisticated classifer
- [ ] param tuning ...
